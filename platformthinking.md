# Platform Thinking — Florez Florez → SaaS Shopping Platform

## The Vision

Build a multi-tenant shopping platform powered by Stripe that charges merchants $5/month — dramatically cheaper than Shopify ($29/month) or Wix/Squarespace ($23-40/month). Merchants only pay the flat fee plus standard Stripe transaction fees (2.9% + $0.30). No platform markup on transactions beyond a small application fee.

Target: small makers, artisans, independent sellers who don't need the full Shopify feature set but want a real storefront.

## Architecture: Fork-Based Provisioning (Not Traditional Multi-Tenancy)

Instead of one database with tenant isolation, the platform is a **provisioner**. Each merchant gets their own isolated instance:

- Their own GitHub repo (fork of the template)
- Their own Vercel project
- Their own Stripe account (connected via Stripe Connect)
- Their own subdomain (or custom domain)

The platform's job is connecting these pieces together. After provisioning, the merchant's shop is self-contained. Their content lives in their GitHub, their store runs on Vercel, their money goes to their Stripe.

---

## What the Platform Needs to Build

### 1. The Platform App (separate from the shop template)
- Signup/onboarding: GitHub OAuth → fork repo → Stripe Connect → provision Vercel → assign URL
- Thin database — provisioning metadata only (not merchant content):
  ```
  merchants: {
    github_username,
    repo_name,
    vercel_project_id,
    stripe_account_id,
    subscription_status
  }
  ```
- Provisioning API: orchestrates GitHub fork, Vercel project creation, env var injection
- Billing: Stripe Billing on the platform's own Stripe account ($5/month subscriptions)
- Subdomain routing: merchant.yourplatform.com

### 2. The Shop Template (what gets forked — the current Florez Florez codebase, generalized)
- Decap CMS config reads repo from the fork's own settings
- Serverless functions use the platform's Stripe key + merchant's connected account ID
- All hardcoded references (repo names, domains) replaced with env vars

---

## Stripe Architecture — Critical Detail

**Do not store each merchant's Stripe secret key in their fork's env vars.**

Use Stripe Connect's `stripe-account` header pattern instead:

```javascript
// In every merchant's /api/checkout.js
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.PLATFORM_STRIPE_KEY); // same key in every fork

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  // ...line_items, shipping, etc.
}, {
  stripeAccount: process.env.MERCHANT_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID, // e.g. acct_1ABC...
  application_fee_amount: Math.round(totalCents * 0.005), // 0.5% platform fee
});
```

This means:
- Every fork has the **same** platform Stripe key — update once, applies everywhere
- `MERCHANT_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID` is the only merchant-specific credential
- Money flows directly to the merchant's Stripe account
- Platform collects a small % application fee on every transaction (on top of $5/month)
- Merchant never touches API keys — they connect Stripe via OAuth during onboarding

This is how Shopify, Squarespace, and every serious platform handles Stripe.

## Key Challenges

### 1. Template Updates (hardest long-term problem)
When the template gets a bug fix or new feature, existing merchant forks don't automatically receive it. Options:
- Automated PRs from template → each fork via GitHub API
- Keep "core" JS/CSS loaded from a platform CDN (outside the fork)
- Accept slower update propagation early, solve properly later

### 2. Vercel Costs at Scale
Each merchant = one Vercel project. Model this early:
- Vercel Pro: ~$20/month for team account, usage-based beyond that
- Estimated ~$0.10–$0.40/month per low-traffic merchant project
- Margins are tight at small scale, improve as you grow
- At 500+ merchants: evaluate Vercel Enterprise or self-hosted deployment

### 3. Decap CMS OAuth Across Custom Domains
GitHub OAuth apps require pre-registered callback URLs — no wildcards supported. If a merchant uses `mystore.com`, the CMS OAuth flow breaks.

**Solution:** Route all OAuth callbacks through `auth.yourplatform.com` — a single proxy that all merchants use regardless of their custom domain. The storefront can be at any domain; the CMS is always accessed via the platform's auth proxy.

### 4. Provisioning Reliability
Forking a repo + creating a Vercel project + setting env vars + mapping a subdomain + completing Stripe Connect OAuth — all in sequence, with error handling and rollback if anything fails midway — is the hardest part of the MVP to get right. This IS the core product.

## Why This Model Works

The key insight: **the platform is a provisioner, not a host of content.** This sidesteps almost all hard multi-tenancy problems:

- No shared database for merchant content (each repo is isolated)
- No content isolation bugs
- Merchant truly owns their data (it's in their GitHub)
- Decap CMS works naturally per-fork
- No complex tenant-aware query logic

The platform's database only stores provisioning metadata — a fraction of what a traditional multi-tenant SaaS requires.

## Unit Economics (rough)

| Revenue | |
|---|---|
| Subscription | $5.00/merchant/month |
| Transaction fee (0.5% on $1,000 GMV) | ~$5.00/merchant/month |
| **Total per merchant** | **~$10/month** |

| Costs | |
|---|---|
| Vercel (est. per merchant) | ~$0.25/month |
| Stripe Connect fees | negligible |
| Platform infrastructure | amortized |
| **Net margin** | **high at scale** |

---

## Build Order

1. **Generalize the template** — remove hardcoded repo names, domains, credentials. Everything merchant-specific becomes an env var.
2. **Stripe Connect onboarding** — OAuth flow, store `stripe_account_id`, update checkout to use `stripe-account` header.
3. **Provisioning API** — GitHub fork + Vercel project creation + env var injection.
4. **Platform landing page + signup flow.**
5. **Subdomain routing.**
6. **Custom domain support** with OAuth proxy for Decap CMS.
7. **Template update mechanism.**

## Relationship to Current Florez Florez Site

The current site is the template. Finish it cleanly with the platform in mind:
- Replace hardcoded values with env vars
- The Decap → Stripe sync complexity (currently being worked on) becomes trivial on the platform — Stripe calls happen against the merchant's connected account, price IDs live in their repo's JSON

Florez Florez itself becomes merchant #1 on the platform once it launches.

## Stack Recommendation

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Shop template | Vanilla JS + Decap CMS (current) |
| Hosting per merchant | Vercel (one project per fork) |
| Content per merchant | GitHub (one repo per fork) |
| Payments | Stripe Connect (Standard accounts) |
| Platform database | Supabase (Postgres — just for provisioning metadata) |
| Platform app | Next.js or similar |
| Auth proxy for CMS | Single Vercel function at auth.platform.com |
| Merchant billing | Stripe Billing (platform's own Stripe account) |
